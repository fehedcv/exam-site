MySQL Practice Exercise â€” Student Course Management
Given the following scenario:

You need to create and manage a simple database to store information about departments, students, courses, and their enrollments with marks.
Task 1: Create Tables (DDL & Constraints)

Write MySQL statements to create the following tables with appropriate data types and constraints:

    Department

        dept_id (Primary Key, integer)

        dept_name (Unique, NOT NULL, varchar(50))

    Student

        roll_no (Primary Key, integer)

        name (NOT NULL, varchar(50))

        age (integer, must be 17 or older)

        dept_id (int)

    Course

        course_id (Primary Key, integer)

        course_name (NOT NULL, varchar(50))

        credits (integer between 1 and 5)

    Enrollment

        roll_no (Foreign Key referencing Student)

        course_id (integer)

        marks (integer between 0 and 100, default 0)

        
Task 2: Insert Sample Data (DML)

Insert at least:

    2 departments (e.g., Computer Science, Electronics)

    3 students with varying ages and departments

    2 courses with credits

    Enrollment records for the students in the courses with marks

Task 3: Write Queries

a. Retrieve the list of all students with their department names.

b. Find all students who scored above 80 marks in any course, showing student name, course name, and marks.

c. Update the marks of a student (choose any student and course) to 95.

d. Try deleting a course and explain what happens (consider foreign key constraints).
